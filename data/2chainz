My rhyme style real nonchalant
Trust me rude boy ain't what you want
Hit your ass up have you doing somersaults
Then I drop your trashy ass off in the garbage
Every week I get my car washed
This is the life of a hustler this is not facade
And what you looking at is not a mirage
You probably see me at the W having a Menage
Performing
Slap a little ass recording
Im doing 160 for my niggas in Porsches
They say I'm speeding cause im on that far left side
I'm from the south but im smoking on that west side
Im in my best ride
I let my girl wash clothes on the G4 so I can let the jet dry
I'm the best I know this
And you ain't even notice
Until I rode up on you in a Lotus
Brushing dust off my shoulders
Like fuck it im focused
Im fucking with bitches thats only fucking with soldiers
Now listen
I got a old school the color of Okra
The tires as wide as Oprah
Watching it when its approaching
Now listen
Peace up
A-Town down
You know I got that piece up so I won't play around
Got a extra round
Plus I got a clip on it
Pollute your block
I put all that shit on it
2chain!
I'm popular and poppin' dough
Breakfast at Pappadeaux's
Dodging all obstacles
Trapping at the Stop-N-Go
Boy you know you lame if you still riding stop and go
Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle
Pardon though I'm hardin' though
You should read the article
I'm riding high and dodging hoes
You better hope im dodging your
Model hoes dollar hoes, white looking Madonna hoes Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo, and the Prada hoes
College ho Zone 3, niggas with a lot of gold
Snoop guard the door
I just love being by the stove
Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul
Like a comma, I love being right next to O's
I had a long day
My nerves bad
Yea I'm smoking on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewlery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands,i can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
We sitting high speaking like we super human beings
Cars malotto, black on black Europeans
Too hard to swallow like UGKings and
Number one thesis do you believe in Jesus
They say money is the root of all diseases
Well call the docotr I see honest in my thesis
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks
Baby momma saying im impatient my sons need shit
When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips
Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips
In zip locks, and garbage bags
Usher Raymond in this bitch yea I got it bad

I'm yelling fuck the world I woke up with my dick hard
Big dog, big broads all in my circumference
Pussy on lock down, I dont hand cuff it
Sipping Grey Goose and we spending mad doucets
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds
Gucci flip flaps, I got bunyons on bunyons
Yellow ring look like a funyon, or somethin'
I just left the trap house, money on money
"All I do is me, masturbation..." Uh oh. For his new single, Canadian emcee Chris Varsity gets a verse from who 2 Chainz.
Yeah birthday, it's your birthday

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio

You the realest nigga breathing if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt, hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer going on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm balling, you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, two everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches
Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh

She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit

Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place

(Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces)
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seeing from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl

'Best believe I'm just slidin' through
Put your panties to the side let me slide through

White coupe, with the white rims

Sandwiches she can't manage it

I was in Detroit, Michigan after going to go visiting with some friends of mine
B-I-G
Okay I'm in motion, I'm rollin' and smoking
And smoking and rollin' like I'm locomotion
I'm walking outside and I'm causing commotion
Got perp and champagne that's a real nigga potion
I'm burnin' bread toasin' and joking
Cause I went from views of my moms house to views of the ocean
Niggas talk shit, But that's free promotion
I'm living my life like the end is approaching
Man fuck these niggas with a passion
I'm gettin' paid from the cradle to the casket
My Grandma said boy you need to read a bible chapter
Till I bought her ass a house bigger than the Pastor's,Hallelujah

This my letter to the rap game
Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane
Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane
I did what I had to do when the pack came
This is my letter to the rap game
Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane
Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane
I did what I had to do when the pack came
Wu Tang Clan, they ain't nothin to fuck, wait
2 Chainz ain't nothing to fuck with
Need search warrants cause these niggas is suspects
All I talk is money so Chainz is the subject
Came in this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, grinding the kush pact
Ride with the roof back, live with a suit act
Killing em, so I am dying my suit black
Dear rap game, you are ill homie
Havin me thinking we were gon' make some real money
Came from the streets, I'm a beast, capiche?
Lock my dick in the mail by the bills held
And hey rap game, the real comin'
The way I'm murking these niggas hope your will comin'
And when you're numb, it's kind of hard to feel somethin'
I'm the type to get rich and still hustle, yeah
And before I leave let me say this, play this
Have my niggas dead or in jail like Asic
Face it, back to the basics
2 Chainz on them bitches, looking like Vegas, the greatest
My worlds coming to an end, speaking philosophical
Six's on the coupe, when they said it was impossible
Got the type of guns to make the city feel uncomfortable
And we breaking bricks down, till the last molecule
Cherish the horizon, sun blessed party, hey
Thinking 'bout this business, and it's time that I gave away
Trying to make a plan today, niggas on there way
Locked in confinement, gotta learn to levitate
And on the inside, my instinct, I survive
All I got left is pride, touchdown, I'mma ride
I was raised as a boss
Damn, I let a nigga take me off
And let him tell Josh that his pops was soft
Mothafucker
Rocking blood diamonds, cooling in the hood with the goonies
Gambling and scrambling, trying to buy us some guchi's
It's a movie made, regardless, my crooks is the hardest
Buying crazy pots and pans, stay in apartments
Bank roll was all we ever needed
While niggas was weeded, playing spades, and pumping crack in adidas
Just fly young with heart, I sift in the park
Made sales, blazed a few shells, yeah fuck who you are
Guns on us, I make you cry like onions come through
Stay in your lane, peep the name and we done it
I was legend yet, now my papar stretching, yeah, that's it
Go ask the Rocky Glass, "I class act?"
Villas, movie-making gorillas, the willas
The guest-star gun fights, squeeze on the squealers
Don't come near me, nigga
If you don't got no money, fear me
Matter fact, move it, ya hear me?
Girl, I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me
They ain’t never seen a nigga like me uh
She ain't never seen a nigga like me uh
Chance of that is unlikely
2 Chainz in my white T
I wipe her down and I pipe her down
I give my girl money to go out of town
You give your girl money to go to Niketown
And I one-night her, you must like her
Kill niggas with one-liners, all I need is one lighter
Counting so much money, I got arthritis
So cold I frostbite 'em, no Pig Latin but I hog-tied 'em
If she gets this business then I (make her fall in love)
With a nigga like me I’m killing this beat
Skeet skeet skeet skeet, skeet on my sheets
On top, from the back, I thundercat like (HOE!)
My girl got a big purse with a purse in it
And her pussy so clean I can go to church in it!
Oh Lord, O-M-G, I am the O-N-E
How ya like me now, it’s cool but she want Mo D
Moet by the fireplace, this is how desire taste
And I’m bout to buy a case (L'ego)
Bon apetite, they obsolete, you know talk I cheap so don’t say a word
Chick, chick, chicken talk, I’m flipping birds, fuck y'all
Mustard, ketchup, I take pills, expert
Kitchen all pyrexed up, if my dick talked it’d say "next up"
Me and yo girl networked, now she wanna know my net worth
Wood grain, chestnut, titty fuck, chest nut!
Move shit, UPS truck, pull a lil' out n out the rest up
Competition need to rest up
I aim at ya head, put the vest up, matter fact put the vest up!
This shit I’m shootin is penetrating, you don’t want this situation
Tall nigga with a short temper, I do this for niggas who never had shit
And now I got me a bad bitch, who got a bad bitch, who got a bad bitch
TRU story, high like 2 stories, 2 Chainz and Tity Boi
Nigga that’s 2 stories, who want it?
Hair weave killa, they like "you don’t want it"
I go swimming in that pussy, 'bout to throw a pool party
I told them, get on my level
Bitch, you could get on this shovel
Coke prices high, than which was if a Tony Montana
I just got me a bezel
My slippers is clean
All I wear Tru Religion
I paid a grip for them jeans
I got a lust for the cream
I need a money machine
I need a money machine
I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, but it ain't nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I say I'm incredible, most legible
Schedule ain't, but I can make your girl flexible, edible
Put her top and call it putting her on my pedestal
You would never know, unless you worked at the bank
Camel toe, look like steak
And your boy look like great
2 gun bang
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane
You can tell your girl here, because a cab came
And I keep it 100, I don't need no spare change
Some do it for the fame, some do it for the fortune
Fortunately I'm famous, 26's wheel of fortune
And I been riding foreign since the fucking introduction
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
Yo it's my time to shine, so I'm checking my Rollie
A bet with the Lakers, I bought a necklace off Kobe
I be fucking your girl, I was texting her only
I told her, "I'd like your legs better if they was open"
Ever since the beginning, niggas knew I was focused
Strip club tour started Magic, ended at Strokers
I'm a fucking example of a fucking example
Hit her from the back, nigga, that's a fucking example
I came up on Luke Campbell, I'm so sick I need Campbells
If you know I'm showing up, I hope you come with your camera
Got the city on swole with my Louis bandana
My car is shitting on niggas, I should ride with a Pamper
I give you something to see when you are looking this way
If you approaching with the drama, then we approach with the K
And when you look in my eyes all you see is the pain
On medication, I can drink 200 a day
When you hot in the A, you get a spot in the A
It's so big that shit look like a spot in the A
These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line
Till somebody rhyme bout beating me, then they start dancing in line
And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30
With my ice on early, in all gold knight sterling
Try to cook a brick off a George Foreman
Take a girl, it'll start spoiling
Living room floor look like a nigga going bowling
I say it's my time to get it, my time to shine
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind
It's my time to get it, my time to shine
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind, bitch

Nothing, Nobody
Can stop me from Loving you
Foreign exchange, I walk in the rain
Still won't get wet
Nigga flick up the flame twist up the game
Switch up the chain
Play peek-a-boo I take ya girl and her friend
And do a switch-a-roo
Started with a nick and got a 62
It was memorable, my planets were digable
Used to stashing work off in a inner tube in middle school
I worked the trap no interviews
Just told shawty that im in to you
I'm the type that make a old school a Bentley coupe
Turn one to ten that's what I tend to do
It's an amber alert I gotta missing roof I
It was black and it was travelling fast
I love you now I dont care about your ratchet past
Designer shoes matching bags
Let them niggas pop shit baby we popping tags
If I ever fall off I'll be hopping back got a bad bitch with me
Told her hop in back my car speak she dark meat
I be eating MC's nigga shark teeth Velourz hoodie
I ask em whats for goody
If you are what you eat but I am not a pussy
You couldn't stop me with a bunch of Uzi's
And all we really do is shoot a bunch of movies
 (x2)
Started from the bottom now we at the top
Graduated from high school and bought a choppa orville
Red and bocker bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl, Cindy Lauper
When they saw me they used to think of dope
But now when they see me they just think of hope
Inspiration no infiltration
Them niggas hatin I got they bitches naked
Hand full of ones pocket full of Hunn
If I was sellin swag man I woulda sold a ton
Designer sneaks leather seats
They say money talk thats why you never speak
Every verse I do is a rest in peace
Wish this highway to heaven had an extra seat rap game extra sweet
Big ass charm conversation peice
Million off rap but the trap was sweeter
When dealings on the block all prices cheaper
I been doing this since guess and fila
They say my entourage each car four deep eight heaters
Drop the middle man to cut the cost
They say my whole click cut from a different cloth
And of course we pay the cost, with each block that we off
You take off and call back it ain't our fault that ya lost ya lil bitch
Ask ya boy bout them forty he lost talk slick Glock
Forty ya boss now you the president
Fresher than peppermint
Whip tint till six bond number nine flow wall street bidness bitch
 (x2)
Started from the bottom now we at the top graduated from high school and bought a choppa orville red and bocker bitch we got it poppin on the block with that white girl cindy lauper
Nothing in the whole wide can stop me
Ooohhhh Noooothing can stop me
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me

True to my religion, promethazine my prescription
I look in the mirror, that's my competition
Then I talk to myself, myself said, "What?"

All my dogs moving like Grey Hounds we pays for
Great car with black wheels, it's looking like a skateboard

Getting figures and fuckin' bitches, she rolling Swishers
Brought her bitches, I brought my niggas, they getting bent up off the liquor

They say money make a nigga act nigger-ish
But least a nigga nigga rich

Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fucking boys, beast
Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leadin' on

Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju.. (Okay, I got it)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin', I beast

She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this di--
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
AKA Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back I'll do ya, beast
Is it me or is it something about a car
That makes a bad bitch get freaky fuck like porno stars?
Or maybe it was that chrome that keep a bopper in the zone
But either way she hit my phone like she can't leave me lone
And that there just keeps happening, blame it on all this rapping shit
10 out of 10 she down to fuck, that's just what my average is
Slab and chassis lavishly, wood cabin, digi-dash in it I'm an advocate
Chromed out wheels if you hop in here you might jet lag a bit
I'm passionate about everything that I want, I do what it do and y'all don't
I put the whole world in my trunk, let it bump
Check the stars out when I ride, dodgin' potholes with these tires
Hogging lanes, swang and bang in a 'Stang so let me by
Cuz I got --
Money on the floor
Lighters on the dresser
Drop my top, no one can do it better
Diamonds and the leather
Wood and the chrome
Bopping ass hoes just won't leave me alone
She call me big baby, I got my Guccis on
Black on black, head to toe, smelling like Prada cologne
Feeling like big pimping, inhale, exhale
Good green, thick lean, give them bitches x pills
Cocaine make them get so loose on them tequila shots
Every time I do it I regret it, the bitch just can't stop
Now she's dancing on the table, skirt done went up to her navel
Niggas throwing money at her, shit I can't be mad at her
You bring the girl to me then I'mma bless her, test her
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
My bitch on the block with some money on her mind
A pistol in her purse and a heart full of grind
I'm pimp type, MJ, drop my top, light that dro
Hand on the wood with the pedal on the floor
Forever get dough and I’m clever on the ho
Still get vetted man, never be a scary man
My DNA is all Ike Turner, Eddie King
25 lighters, 25 cyphers
Went to jail and shared a cell with a 25-to-lifer
Stayed at my grandma house with 25 bibles
Stayed in the trap house with like 25 rifles
Drop my top and I dip dip dip
But if I pop my trunk you better duck, don't slip
Chrome lips on the vehicle look like they blowing kisses
Reel them hoes in, it look like I'm going fishing
Okay this how I ride, two bad hoes inside
One ho say she ready, the other ho said she tired
I'mma drop this other ho off, me and the other ho we gon ride
All jokes aside I'm the get money poster child
Opening doors like an answer key, I make the life answer to me, no fantasy
An evil genius, I leave my mark of the beast on the beat
Actually, I'm all like a natural disaster, I make you a casuality
Added up, mathematically, putting numbers up, like 23
And I'm Manning up like Payton be, game is over, I should take a knee
And bow out gracefully, even if you look me in my eyes
See you wouldn't be facing me
So what the fuck is pain to me?
And what the hell is rain to me?
My life is very impressionable, like a Van Gogh painting be
Told me Vincent inside the dimension, that's my mantra
Listen there is no competition, the mission's conquered
Did I mention? These girls at my concert, addicted, no double entendre
Which is why I'm colder than a tundra on Christmas, put your hands up, can I get a witness?
While I kill the dark side's where I live
Horny devils and a red dress and high heels
You don't have an idea how many niggas done took my ideas
I take flight, I'm so bright, I don't even get no light bia
You road kill while I'm driving
I'm high fiving, my dime riding, My time shining
From at the club and I'm outta town but I'm lying around it
Deuce chains I'm fung shway, everyday is my birthday
2 gats at the park, you don't wanna see these guns play
Patron and lemon lime, I got her back, all in her spine
I look my wife up in the eyes, and I think about a another dime
My atmosphere is fractured here this right here is bally gear and I keep on killing shit
And I don't even have no tatted tear
You can put the motherfucker caddie here
You can put the motherfucker beemer there
Still got 2 more garage places, louies on I unlaced it
Every verse I'm going crazy, every girl it's going crazy
2 guns, 2 chains, 2 rings, 2 bracelets
This Jet Life, don't scrub, you blot that
Flow rugs in the Porsche, I'm out front and got my top back
Label me a author, forefounder of lifestyle rap
Watching these niggas borrow game
Not acknowledging where they got that
Though I fall back, let them run with that, consider those my rebel kids
Clashing with they father figure
When they know they wanna be just like him
Where might I have been without my pen
To scribble about what I done wit 'em
Girls that I took home last night, Chevys I sat on top them rims
I'm good in front of that camera lens, weed smoke when my video spins
At her house, rolling up in her boy shorts, my mafia bitch
Plotting up, I'm counting up, going for it cause I go and get it
So you liable to see her with me, my pockets fat, my tires skinny
Loud pack, got a louder engine, 80 large, all Benjamins
Vacationing, 2 nights spending, I ain't tripping
Fool I know how to get that back, homie my triple O showed me that
Same thing showed my how to roll them Zags
And my reputation precedes me, they already know
I keep it capital G apostrophe D
Going hard, making it look easy
Cause when I do what it do, I do it like I'm doing it for TV
You know I do it like I'm doing it for do
Watch the shoes, ostrich, you know what time it is like 2 watches
My reputation, detonation on destination
I separated, elevated: get salutation
I'm seldom seen in forest green foreign machine
Dirty south but the engine clean and that pussy clean
Criminal thing, a criminal mind
I got a pocket full of dead presidents, I'mma bring them alive
Riding shotgun with that K on the side
Bitches that I'm done with, let them lay on the side
Clock on your mind, I'm ahead of your time
Hublot transform like Optimus Prime
Diamonds on, diamonds off, shawty ass kinda soft
Tattoos, lip gloss, pockets on Rick Ross
I'm fantasizing a tantalizing experience
Bitches like photography, I just take a pick
I'm up in this, 442 on them Budnik rims
Somewhat a pimp
All them gangsta bitches fuck with him
Bring ducketts in
When records wasn't really bumping, they was in love with him
To see him balling is like drugs to them
Mama calling for that Jet to put a reservation in
Ain't concerned where she going 'long as she stay with him
They be seeking that foundation, stable niggas with paper
I'm all that, but I'm stingy, you ain't write n'an one of these raps
And love, I'm so serious, you might get high from hearin' it
Get stupid fly at any event, spray some Ozium in that vent
Bring them hoes and tell them shake that shit, send my jail niggas flicks
We live it, she love it, in the kitchen, in the oven mitt
It's Jet Life over e'ry bitch
And e'ry bitch ass nigga breaking they back, tryna take care of them
We get high, we laugh at them
I swear ain't no comparin' them to no nigga in my area
This Jet Life, no play time, we cut them hoes, you carry them

Bitch Cash Money is an army, Oorah
Tunechi be what they call me, I’m everything but sorry
Get a bad-ass high yellow bitch to come and ride my horse, I named it Charlie
No cream in my coffee, don’t bleed on my carpet
I falls in love with all these hoes, but it’s money over bitches regardless
I’m so high I won’t come down, boy my pack be dumb loud
Waiting for one of these niggas to cross the line, like a touchdown
I gotchu, I’m Piru, bitch I’m out there by you
Blade on the AK, cut your ass like high school

Every car I drive, niggas want one of them
They pointin', they pointin

They pointin', they pointin
They like dammmmmn
Like Ricky Ross, everyday I'm hustlin'
Gettin' off weight (like who?) Jennifer Hudson
Pack a hammer, Thor
Shooter, score
Slide through batches think I'm hecka rich
Breakin' necks, turnin' heads like the exorcist
Thumbs up like the like button
Eatin' good, no rib touchin'
Runnin' with a bundle, never fumble
Countin' so much bread I got Carpal tunnel
Stock paint (from where?) Maaco
Beige, like a potato
They hate me on the outside, love me in the inside
Suck me in the back seat while I let a friend drive
Half a pound two stacks, half a unit 10-5
I stay out here by Sully so you know a hustler been fly
Repeat Hook
My pockets some'n serious, mansion on a hilly
Main that nigga got more cheese than a philly
Shoelace tied but a nigga still trippin'
I'm Lionel Richie high, I'm dancin' on the ceiling
Never marry a hoes, I just marry checks
That's how you stay on top, missionary sex
Rubba Band Business, know you heard of that
I got the town talkin, know you scurred of that
None less than ten figures, you know what I'm worth
Record sales, show money, not including merch'
Club full of bitches, pocket full of Franks
Blunt full of weed, cup full of drank
Me going raw dog, ain't no way in hell
Before I risk my life it be a cold day in hell
But bitch take it off, here we go show and tell
And I'm fuckin' that pussy like I'm fresh out of jail
Repeat Hook
Parallel park while I'm ghost riding
Black diamonds man I'm racial profiling
I'm so fly man I need a co-pilot
So I might let your damn ho drive it
Lil' hair pullin' man I like rough sex
Dropped out, I ain't never passed a drug test
You know my lingo baby let's mingle
So I got a thousand dollars worth of singles
I got racks in the cargo of my camels
Still, still won't give her Nathaniel
Life a gamble so I had to make a bet
These ain't Air Max but make a check
They took me out the streets but it's still in me
I been sellin' work since we had Bill Clinton
I'm the voice of the streets so they still listen
On the back of the milk carton, ceiling missing
Repeat Hook
So I let the bitch hang out with me right
You know word got around I was fucking this nigga bitch
So the nigga called me, he like "You fuckin my bitch"-
I'm like I'm fuckin her right now
Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls

Stuntin' on them bitches like Birdman
Roll the weed in white sheets, Ku Klux Klan
Put it on the scale, watch it do numbers
Playing with them keys like Stevie Wonder
All my hoes pretty, all my niggas Brazy
We sell that white, sell that brown, call it rice and gravy
Call me Tunechi Lee or dont call me at all
Man fuck all you niggas, PAUSE
2 Chainz, that's your best answer
Cup filled with pink, I'm supporting breast cancer
I might do that walk for the 5k
I get paid every time I leave my driveway
Got yo girl tip-toeing on my marble floors
Sitting by the pool, jumping off the diving board
Getting to the money I'mma need a money counter
So many acres, my neighbors stay in another county
Ted Dibiase in Versace loafers
All you talk is shit nigga Halitosis
Ghosts, I pulled up in that pale thang
Got a Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain
GODDAMN!
Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back

Cause I know I get it back

Cash on hand, cash on deck
Give me everything 3 X
And all 12's up off that rack
Wash my stash with Ajax
Me and Tit, back to back
And we ridin' around, smoking Kush by the pound
Like how it ride but we love how it sound
Drop-top Lam so low to the ground
Just like a snail, I'm close to the earth
Waves on my temp, so a ho gotta surf
Hollering rock -- when you're scared, go to church
Me and Slim Dunk in the club throwing racks
Go into the trap and I get it right back
Want 10 bricks? You can get it right now
Pull to the trap house, come to the back
Riding domestic with the trunk in the back
Riding in a foreign, so the trunk in the front
Sixty thousand cash just for me to roll blunts
Standing in front, blowing kush through her dress
Five grand just to see her dance
Ten grand just to see her tats
Jump in the corner and he smoking on her clit
Waiting on you, so he get it right back
In the club, throwin' money
I done run through me some racks
Give a fuck bout that little paper
I know I get it back
Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back

Tell them, come and get this paper
Yeah, my bitch is made in Asia
And I'm icy like a glacier
Get your baby momma
Take her then make her
You date her, then fuck her
I fuck her, then date her
Everything is on the up
Like a elevator
Gucci Mane and Tity Boi
College Park and Decatur
Now I do it for the haters
Started with a Buick LeSabre
Ended with that Ferrari
Tell me, meet me up out in Vegas
Got so many acres
I don't ever see my neighbors
Niggas say they want a mil
I put money on the table
Holiday Season, bitch!

Do it with no compassion
Do it without her asking

I was born to be what I was gonna be
Forgiato’s up under me
Concrete up on the deck
Gave the rear-view mirror a heart attack - BOOM!
Bottom. Name a nigga out here hotter
Damn, that's one of my problems
Living like it's no tomorrow....

Take your main lady out and have her doin' drugs
Take your main lady out like I do the chores

These niggas ain't hear me then, these niggas gonna hear me now
I got bad hoes in my section, these niggas wanna burn me down
So I'm gon' make it sparkle, tell the waiter come serve me now
Just Ciroc bottles and top models, all real niggas that pop hollows
I pulled up and I drop-topped, and my bad bitch just popped out
And like Alakazam! This shit way out of my hands!
And I'm with black card shawty, vroom-vroom jumpin out of that Lamb
Well damn, it's YSL in my shirt, fly as hell off Earth

Early bird get the worm, I'm up way before y'all
I don't even know y'all, riding with the doors off
Fuck her on the lean, then I fucking doze off!
The dope man is my role model, I had a TV on top of my floor model
That bitch would show, fiends used to smoke dope out the antenna
Closet full of amphibians, aim at it and hit it
Difference between me and your girl: my girl, ass thicker
Life sentence my trunk, real niggas respect it
Dumb charm on my necklace, stupid watch on my left wrist
I ain't have a lot so I brag a lot, when I got a lot, I pop a lot
I bought a drop, bought some pussy, get head in the parking lot
My rhyme style's unorthodox, my weed stank no Tic-Tac
Asking me where I get that, Gucci sat on my flip flap!
Paint job cost 10 stacks, rims cost me another ten
So tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
Straight like that nigga, straight like that
No birthday get cake like that
And I ball hard niggas hate like that
Cause I drop that work, come straight right back like whoa
I peeled off in the Bent, came straight right back in a Rolls
Peeled off with ya bitch, came straight right back with y'all
Nigga we share that bitch, 10 big chains I don't wear that shit
Big Glock 9, I air that shit

And they be like word, I'm with a bad bitch, but I wouldn't wife her
My neck all froze and my wrist like burr

Boxing gloves: I'll beat the trial

My Black Bentley is rented, right now I'm stackin
This is my passion, I'm out Atlanta, smashing some action
And it's not just talk, when I get to the box I'm as dashing like Cassius
For the nights I was suffering, bought a condo out in Buckhead
Like a condom that's scuffed up, I'm the wrong one to fuck with
Love it, they need it, the illest young'un to speak it
It's really something about me that make hot emcees go anemic

Wet lips on the rims: I call em "blow job"
If they ain't getting money tell em "go rob"
Yea I'm ballin' hard like a globetrotter
Now I got em on they toes cause my flow hotter
I'm balling bitch: globetrotter
If that pussy good, I tell that bitch "Let's go shopping"
These shoes right here ain't come from Foot Locker
I give a girl what she want - but no dollars

3 cell phones and still I won't call a bitch
I like mine with no pork in it, want a meal with no fork in it
Outfit, I ordered it and I'm the shit? Where your toilet at?

Too dope, two cups, this codeine not cognac
Come close, catch a contact, I got a loud pack in my cargo pocket
Got your girl in my condo poppin and ain't no way you're gonna stop it
Hard top, I'm gonna drop it, when I drop the top, she drops her ass

Sub-zero flow, when I spit, I see snow flurries
Scarface, all out
All I want in this world

It ain't nothin' to me but it's somethin' to you
Count money like it's somethin' to do
Summer time I'm like fuck the roof, winter time I'm in 'Lo boots
And uh, it's nothin'
I like being high because it's a better view
And, I told your ho my chain so cold it's on Theraflu
